title: Assignments
---
body:

Assignments will be published as Jupyter notebooks.
Students will accomplish specific tasks by writing Python code in these notebooks, in a manner similar to the course notebooks.
Assignment submissions will include the completed Jupyter notebooks.

Solutions will be published on the [Calendar](/calendar) page as soon as possible.

### Grades
  
- The final assignments grade will be the average of the 3 best grades out of the 4 assignments: `assignments_grade = sum(sorted(grades)[1:]) / 3`. 
- Assignment #0 will not be graded.
- The final assignments grade will determine 20% of the course grade: `final_grade = int(0.2 * assignments_grade + 0.8 * project_grade)`.
- Specifically, you can submit only 3 assignments and still get the maximum 20 points.
- To appeal assignment grades, please write a detailed _printed_ appeal and submit it to the course instructor during office hours. Appeals will _not_ be accepted via forum or email.
 
### Deadlines

Assignments are due at 23:59.
The due dates for all assignments are on the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a> page.

#### Late Policy:

- All students have 3 free "late days" for the semester.
- Submissions are timestamped by their calendar date in Israel; for a deadline on Thursday, a submission on Friday at 00:20 (or even 00:02) counts for a full "late day".
- You may not submit assignments after exausting these "late days".
- Assignments may not be submitted more than 2 days late.
- Exceptions per TAU policy: reserve duty, pregnancy, illness, etc. See official TAU rules.
- You may not use "late days" for the final project.

### Submission instructions

- Assignments should be submitted on [Moodle](https://ims.tau.ac.il/tal/kr/search_l.aspx?course_num=04313377&year=2022).
- Your name **should not** be included in the notebook or in the filename.
- Your submission should be named `AX.ipynb`, where `X` is replaced with the assignment number, e.g. `A3.ipynb` for assignment #3.
- Please submit each assignment in its dedicated submission page.
- Unless otherwise mentioned, please submit a single notebook file (`.ipynb`)  containing all your figures (i.e. use `%matplotlib inline`).
- **Do not email** your assignments.

### Collaboration Policy

- I expect students to understand and complete their own assignments and to submit one assignment per student.
- You **may** discuss the assignment with other students.
- You **may not** share assignment code with other students.
- You **may not** write assignment code together with other students.
